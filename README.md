Unix-CB, a chat system from the olden days

Unix-CB (or CB for short) was an attempt to bring CB (Citizen's Band radio) to the computer.  You could hang out on a channel and talk with your friends.  If someone was annoying you could squelch them.

CB was originally written in Fortran for an IBM/370 mainframe running [MUSIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=MUSIC/SP).  It was then ported to Unix and C, first running on a Convergent Technologies [Miniframe](http://sourcedelica.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/convergent-miniframe.png) and then on SCO Xenix, an early System V-on-80386.

CB was part of Skynet, a multi-line BBS package. [Morrison Hotel](http://bbslist.textfiles.com/714/oldschool.html).  Morrison Hotel was the first (and regrettably, only) Skynet BBS, based in Orange County, CA in the mid-late 80s

A number of chat systems based on the CB user interface were developed in the 90s, including [Unix-CB](https://github.com/ggrossman/unix-cb) by Gary Grossman (which was used by the hugely popular [Vrave](http://hyperreal.org/raves/vrave/)).  If you want to see what it was like there is a running replica called Enormous Trousers.  At your command line run `telnet chat.f4.ca 6623`.

Unix-CB uses System V IPC for communication, shared memory and synchonization.

I put the code up on GitHub for sentimental reasons. I would have all of the code for Skynet but unfortunately it appears to be lost forever...   Thanks to Gary we were able to get CB compiling again.
