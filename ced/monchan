The channel monitoring feature allows you to specify one channel to
be considered "public" and be monitored by users when they are on other
channels.  The "monitor" command (usually /m) may be enabled to allow
users to listen to this channel from any channel.  In addition to the
"monitor" command, a range of channels may be set up similar to the
limited channel series that will automatically monitor the channel set
here.
