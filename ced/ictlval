The CB control flag is used to store configuration information about
CB that can be changed on-the-fly.  The control flag may be set to an
initial value with this setting.  The setting may be given in decimal,
octal, or hexdecimal.  If octal is used, preface the number with a 0. 
If hexidecimal is used, preface the number with a 0x.  To set multiple
flags specify the addition of the flags.  The control flags used are
(in octal):
	01	Lock out CB
	02	Unpaid users are read-only
	04	Unvalidated users are read-only
